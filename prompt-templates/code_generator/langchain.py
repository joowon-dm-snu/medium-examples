Question: "copy the files in the directory named 'target' into a new directory at the same level as target called 'myNewDirectory'"

I need to take the following actions:
- List all files in the directory
- Create a new directory
- Copy the files from the first directory into the second directory
```bash
ls
mkdir myNewDirectory
cp -r target/* myNewDirectory

If the question does not seem related to the API, return I don't know. Do not make up an answer.
Only use information provided by the tools to construct your response.

First, find the base URL needed to make the request.

Second, find the relevant paths needed to answer the question. Take note that, sometimes, you might need to make more than one request to more than one path to answer the question.

Third, find the required parameters needed to make the request. For GET requests, these are usually URL parameters and for POST requests, these are request body parameters.

Fourth, make the requests needed to answer the question. Ensure that you are sending the correct parameters to the request by checking which parameters are required. For parameters with a fixed set of values, please use the spec to look at which values are allowed.

Use the exact parameter names as listed in the spec, do not make up any names or abbreviate the names of parameters.
If you get a not found error, ensure that you are using a path that actually exists in the spec.
